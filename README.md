## Overview
The project uses **K-Means**, **DBSCAN**, and **Hierarchical Clustering** algorithms to group customers. By analyzing the clustering results, businesses can gain insights into different customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.

### Project Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for clustering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to understand the patterns and relationships.
3. **Modeling**: Apply K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms.
4. **Evaluation**: Analyze the results using evaluation metrics like silhouette scores.
5. **Visualization**: Use plots to visualize the clusters.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** - Programming language used for data processing and modeling.
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Numpy** - Numerical computing library for handling large data arrays.
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning library for clustering algorithms.
- **Matplotlib** - Plotting library for visualizing results.
- **Seaborn** - Data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, containing over 8,000 customer records. It includes demographic information (e.g., age, gender, income) and spending behavior (e.g., annual spend on products, online spending score).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
cd customer-segmentation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Dataset

Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and place it in the `data/` directory of the project.

## Running the Project

### 1. Jupyter Notebook

To run the project, open and execute the Jupyter notebook. It includes the implementation of the customer segmentation process:

```bash
jupyter notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb
```

## Usage

### 1. Data Preprocessing

The notebook loads the dataset and performs the following steps:

* Handling missing values.
* Encoding categorical variables.
* Scaling numerical data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations like histograms and scatter plots are used to understand the distribution of customer features.

### 3. Clustering Algorithms

Three clustering algorithms are applied:

* **K-Means Clustering**: Groups customers into a fixed number of clusters based on feature similarity.
* **DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering algorithm that can detect clusters of varying shapes.
* **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a dendrogram to visualize the customer clusters hierarchically.

### 4. Evaluation

Clustering results are evaluated using silhouette scores and visual inspection.

### 5. Visualization

2D and 3D plots (using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`) are used to visualize the clusters formed by each algorithm.

## Results

* **K-Means Clustering**: Produced reasonable results for well-separated clusters but struggled with irregularly shaped clusters.
* **DBSCAN**: Successfully identified dense clusters, especially useful for outliers, but required parameter tuning for optimal performance.
* **Hierarchical Clustering**: Best-performing algorithm with clear customer segments when analyzed through a dendrogram.

## Challenges

* **Data Cleaning**: Missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features were handled before applying clustering algorithms.
* **Parameter Tuning**: Choosing the right number of clusters in K-Means and setting the correct parameters for DBSCAN.
* **Cluster Validation**: No ground truth labels were available, so silhouette scores and visual validation were used to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

## Future Improvements

* Implement advanced feature engineering techniques to improve clustering accuracy.
* Test additional clustering algorithms like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to handle mixed data types.
* Explore domain-specific features like customer behavior trends for further segmentation improvements.
