## Overview
The project uses **K-Means**, **DBSCAN**, and **Hierarchical Clustering** algorithms to group customers. By analyzing the clustering results, businesses can gain insights into different customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.

### Project Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for clustering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to understand the patterns and relationships.
3. **Modeling**: Apply K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms.
4. **Evaluation**: Analyze the results using evaluation metrics like silhouette scores.
5. **Visualization**: Use plots to visualize the clusters.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** - Programming language used for data processing and modeling.
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Numpy** - Numerical computing library for handling large data arrays.
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning library for clustering algorithms.
- **Matplotlib** - Plotting library for visualizing results.
- **Seaborn** - Data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, containing over 8,000 customer records. It includes demographic information (e.g., age, gender, income) and spending behavior (e.g., annual spend on products, online spending score).
